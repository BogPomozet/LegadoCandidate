Exercise Instructions

The aim of this exercise is recreate the Figma design using html and css, though feel free to use other frameworks if you wish.

The page does not have to be functional (i.e. no need for the Submit answer button to actually submit anywhere) but the input box should be an input box, the buttons should be buttons, the checkbox should check etc.

Take care to copy the styling from Figma and ensure the page is responsive.

It is up to you how you submit the exercise. Github would be preferable. 

We don't want you to spend days and days on this. A few hours should be ok.

The Figma design can be found here: https://www.figma.com/file/MFZbohdOBidu48YdEaWZlZ/Legado%3A-Candidates?node-id=0%3A1&t=RjErFD4mbgrIaP90-1

If anything is unclear or you have any questions, please email to ask.

Good luck!
